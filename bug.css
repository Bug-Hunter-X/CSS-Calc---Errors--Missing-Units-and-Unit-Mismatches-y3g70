The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, there might be unexpected behavior if you don't carefully consider operator precedence and unit compatibility. For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works well, but `width: calc(100% - 10);` might lead to unexpected results because the unit is missing for `10`. Similarly, using `calc()` with multiple units without proper conversion may also cause problems.
